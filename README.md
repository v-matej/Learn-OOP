# Learn-OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP enables developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by focusing on concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This README provides an overview of OOP and explains how the exercises in this repository introduce the basics of OOP.

# What is OOP?
OOP revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on that data. Key principles of OOP include:

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together into objects, allowing for data hiding and ensuring that object internals are accessed through defined interfaces.
Inheritance: Defining new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and behaviors, and allowing for code reuse and specialization.
Polymorphism: The ability for objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, providing flexibility and extensibility.
OOP provides a modular approach to software development, promoting code organization, reusability, and scalability.

# Repository Overview
This repository aims to introduce the basics of OOP through a series of simple exercises. The exercises are designed to gradually build your understanding of OOP concepts and help you apply them in practical scenarios.

The exercises cover fundamental topics such as:

Class and object creation
Class attributes and instance variables
Methods and functions within classes
Inheritance and subclassing
Polymorphism and method overriding
By completing these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing OOP concepts and develop a solid foundation for further exploration of more advanced OOP principles and design patterns.
